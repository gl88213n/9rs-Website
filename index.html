            <h2>For a very special girl</h2>
            
            <p>Welcome to your very own website! I've personalized and crafted this especially
                for you! I hope you love it as much as I love you.
            </p>

            <p>In this website I will add my fav pics of you, us, and you with friends teehee. Allowing us to revisit
                wonderful memories. I will continue to add to it as I learn how to add to better to the webpage
                lol. 
                 </p>

            <p>I also created a section with a list of reasons why I love you so you NEVER forget. 
                Although it won't be everything because there's a million reasons why I love you, 
                I hope you find comfort in the reasons why I feel so much love for you sweet girl.
            </p>
            <p>And yes I added a Contact Me section becuase I learned it in class and I just thought it would be funny :) </p>
