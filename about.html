            <p> Why I love you:</p>
            <ul>
        <li>Your creativity, as you know. It's inspiring to people around you, such a creative mind.</li>
        <li>You are incredibly talented, it's truly mesmerizing and it makes me fall so deeply</li>
        <li>You are an amazing friend not just to me, you're so considerate and caring</li>
        <li>You are so kind to everyone even when people may not deserve such kindness from such an amazing woman</li>
        <li>You think about others so often even sometimes before yourself because you're so considerate</li>
        <li>Even on your bad days you still try to cheer others (sometimes me) up</li>
        <li>Your resillience is admirable, you go through so much hardship and you still bounce back everytime</li>
        <li>Your intelligence truly praiseworthy, I love to learn from you especially in the areas you thrive in terms of knowledge (like music!)</li>
        <li>You love to learn about whatever the people around you care about like how you ask about my culture and language!</li>
        <li>The way you're so open to different foods is so wonderful, makes me want to try anything</li>
        <li>You're a great listener and always offer advice even if you have your own thing going on</li>
        <li>You're a very grateful person and I think it's so sweet like when you get so excited when I just get you twizzlers</li>
        <li>You try to make everyone around you feel comfortable and not left out, making you such a joy to be around</li>
        <li>You are beautiful beyond physicality, your mind and your heart radiate such beauty I can see it on you</li>
        <li>The way you can encourage others (like me) to be creative and open their minds is truly commendable</li>
        <li>You are so incredibly thoughtful and it shows in your gifts especially, you always put so much thought and effort into them I almost feel undeserving. </li>
        <lil>Your willingness to try new things especially for your friends even if you don't think you'll like it (partays)</lil>
        <p> Now this isn't everything and as I am reminded of things, I will add to this. But never forget how loved you are. Because who wouldn't love a woman like you!</p>
